Android UX proposal to add a Share &amp; Delete option to system share sheet
# 📱 Android UX Enhancement Proposal: Share & Delete

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Sharing temporary photos or files (e.g., group pictures, memes, receipts) is common, but users often forget or avoid going back to delete them afterward. This leads to unnecessary storage usage and cluttered galleries.

## 💡 Proposed Feature: "Share & Delete"

Integrate a new action in Android's native Share Sheet UI: **"Share & Delete"**. This option appears alongside the standard "Share" and allows users to instantly delete the file(s) after sharing.

### 🎯 Goals:

* Save user time and effort.
* Reduce device storage waste.
* Improve Android sharing UX.

## 📲 How It Works

1. User selects media (images, videos, files).
2. Taps the **Share** button.
3. Android Share Sheet opens with two options:

   * 📤 **Share** (standard behavior)
   * 🗑️ **Share & Delete** (new)
4. User selects destination (WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.)
5. After successful share, a prompt appears:

   * *"Delete these files from your device?"*
   * ✅ Yes → Deletes
   * ❌ No → Keeps

## 🔐 Security & UX Safeguards

* Confirm deletion before proceeding.
* Show undo option (Snackbar or Recycle Bin).
* Only delete if share completes successfully.

## 🧠 Technical Notes

* Uses Android's Intent system: `Intent.EXTRA_STREAM`
* Deletes via MediaStore or FileProvider
* Optional backup integration (e.g., Google Drive)

## 💥 Impact & Benefits

* Simplifies frequent sharing workflows
* Helps users with low storage
* Cleaner galleries & improved organization
